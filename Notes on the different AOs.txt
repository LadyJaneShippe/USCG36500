Notes.

There are a couple of cases here were multiple versions of the same AO file are provided.
When making AOs, dependig on rander settings, they come out darker or lighter.
This is useful when making textures a so I keep multiple versions.
You can use whichever you like, select the one that is suitable for your texture, or combine them as required.

If you need help with this, please contacte me.
